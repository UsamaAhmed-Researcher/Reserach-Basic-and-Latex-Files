– “Research is often described as an active, diligent, and systematic process of
inquiry aimed at discovering, interpreting, and revising facts.
– This intellectual investigation produces a greater knowledge of events, behaviors, theories, and laws and makes practical applications possible.
– The term research is also used to describe an entire collection of information
about a particular subject, and is usually associated with the output of science
and the scientific method.”

What are the different types of research? 

Research is important both in scientific and non-scientific fields. The research is broadly classified into two main classes:

 Fundamental or Basic Research
 Applied Research

1. Fundamental or Basic Research
Basic research is an investigation of basic principles and reasons for the occurrence of a particular event, process, or phenomenon. It is also called theoretical research. The study or investigation of some natural phenomenon relating to pure science is termed basic research. Basic research sometimes may not lead to immediate use or application. It is not concerned with solving any practical problems of immediate interest. But it is original or basic in character. It provides a systematic and deep insight into a problem and facilitates the extraction of scientific and logical explanations and conclusions on it. It helps build new frontiers of knowledge. The outcomes of basic research form the basis for many applied research.

2. Applied Research
In applied research, one solves certain problems employing well-known and accepted theories and principles. Most of the experimental research, case studies, and interdisciplinary research are essentially applied research. Applied research is helpful for basic research. Research, the outcome of which has immediate application, is also termed applied research. Such a research
is of practical use to the current activity.

Basic and applied research, further divided into three types of research bearing some characteristics feature as follows:
 Quantitative research
 Qualitative research
 Mixed research

3. Quantitative research
 It is numerical, non-descriptive, applies statistics or mathematics and uses numbers.
 It is an iterative process whereby evidence is evaluated.
 The results are often presented in tables and graphs.
 It is conclusive.
 It investigates the what, where and when of decision making.
4. Qualitative research
 It is non-numerical, descriptive, applies reasoning and uses words.
 Its aim is to get the meaning, feeling and describe the situation.
 Qualitative data cannot be graphed.
 It is exploratory.

 It investigates the why and how of decision making.
5. Mixed research
Mixed research- research that involves the mixing of quantitative and qualitative methods or
paradigm characteristics. Nature of data is mixture of variables, words and images.
6. Exploratory Research
Exploratory research might involve a literature search or conducting focus group interviews.
The exploration of new phenomena in this way may help the researcher’s need for better
understanding, may test the feasibility of a more extensive study, or determine the best methods
to be used in a subsequent study. For these reasons, exploratory research is broad in focus and
rarely provides definite answers to specific research issues. The objective of exploratory
research is to identify key issues and key variables.
7. Descriptive research
The descriptive research is directed toward studying “what” and how many off this “what”.
Thus, it is directed toward answering questions such as, “What is this?”.
8. Explanatory research
Its primary goal is to understand or to explain relationships.
It uses correlations to study relationships between dimensions or characteristics off individuals,
groups, situations, or events.
Explanatory research explains (How the parts of a phenomenon are related to each other).
Explanatory research asks the “Why” question.
9. Longitudinal Research
Research carried out longitudinally involves data collection at multiple points in time.
Longitudinal studies may take the form of:
 Trend study- looks at population characteristics over time, e.g. organizational absenteeism rates
during the course of a year
 Cohort study- traces a sub-population over time, e.g. absenteeism rates for the sales
department;
 Panel study- traces the same sample over time, e.g. graduate career tracks over the period 1990
– 2000 for the same starting cohort.
While longitudinal studies will often be more time consuming and expensive than cross-sectional
studies, they are more likely to identify causal relationships between variables.
10. Cross-sectional Research
One-shot or cross-sectional studies are those in which data is gathered once, during a period of
days, weeks or months. Many cross-sectional studies are exploratory or descriptive in purpose.
They are designed to look at how things are now, without any sense of whether there is a history
or trend at work.
11. Action research
Fact findings to improve the quality of action in the social world
12. Policy-Oriented Research
Reports employing this type of research focus on the question ‘How can problem ‘X’ be solved
or prevented?’
13. Classification research
 It aims at categorization of units in to groups
 To demonstrate differences
 To explain relationships
14. Comparative research
To identify similarities and differences between units at all levels
15. Causal research
It aims at establishing cause and effect relationship among variable
16. Theory-testing research
It aims at testing validity of a unit
17. Theory-building research
To establish and formulate the theory
18. Field Research
Field research takes place in a natural or real-world setting
